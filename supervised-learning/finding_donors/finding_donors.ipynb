    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Models picked: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Trees**\n",
    "- Real-world application: Recommender systems (e.g. recommending products to an online shopper according to their profile characteristics: age, location, education, family size etc). Banking (loan or investment decisions).  \n",
    "- Strengths: Results сan be easily interpreted, e.g. particular products are popular with married men who have higher education and age >45. Performs well on data where decisions can be made by assigning certain thresholds on values of different continuous features, and particular values or ranges of categorical features.\n",
    "- Weaknesses: Tends to overfit training data, so requires hyper-parameter tuning (min_leaf_split, max_depth etc). May not catch non-linear and complex correlations between features and target, ones that cannot be easily expressed with thresholds or ranges. Also, is non-robust (small changes in data invokes large change in the tree and predictions, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)\n",
    "- Given the data, it seems that relashionships between features and income possibly can be expressed with thresholds, e.g. with age it is probably certain productive period of life ( > 18 and < 65); with workclass it is probably that certain categories cannot be considered as making more than 50K e.g. 'Without-pay'; with education - certain education level tends to help people earn more money, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest**\n",
    "\n",
    "All the answers pertaining to Decision Trees can be applied here, except Random Forrest purpose is to eliminate the main weakness of the Decision Tree, namely overfitting. Basically this is an Ensemple technique for Decision Trees.\n",
    "- Strengths: Much better generalization as compared to Decision Tree, given the right hyper-parameters.\n",
    "- Weaknesses: Requires more models to be trained since it is an ensemble. Also, in addition to underlying Tree hyper-parameters, there's more hyper-parameters to tune, e.g. number of Tree Models, number of features to randomly select for each tree in the forrest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machines**\n",
    "- Real-world application: Any linear problem, or non-linear problem that can be reduced to linear with a polynomial function (polynomial kernel), or when data forms clusters in terms of similar values of some features in certain ranges tend to belong to the same class (rbf kernel). SVM is known to be used in solving the following problems: text and hypertext categorization, classification of images, protein classification and other applications in biology: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine \n",
    "- Strengths: Sometime can be interpreted by visualizing a hyperplane, or surface in hyper-space separating the data. Certain conclusions may become possible from such visualization, that were otherwise unclear. Another strength is that due to kernels a wide range of non-linear problems can be covered with these models without getting into models that require much bigger computational power like deep neural networks. \n",
    "- Weaknesses: Requires hyper parameter tuning, not immediately clear what kernel function to use with non-linear problems. Takes more computational power to train with kernels (as compared with Decision Trees for example).\n",
    "- Given the data, I think it is more or less safe to assume that correlations in data do not have extremely complex nature. They are probably not linear, but rbf kernel may produce reasonable accuracy.\n",

Besides, we see that Random Forrest was able to fit (overfit) the training data pretty well, so we just need to apply some generalization techniques to reduce overfitting, and Random Forrest has a number of parameters we could play with, that do precisely that (reduce overfitting)."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

One of the reasons: with  training time reduced, we could spend more time grid-searching for right hyper-parameters, and probably could find them with less time spent. And it would also give us smaller prediction times."
